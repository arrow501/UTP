Plan:

1. **Database Class**
    - The `Database` class will be responsible for all database operations. It will use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to the database. We will use SQLite as the database for simplicity and portability.
    - The `Database` class will have a `create()` method that will create a new table (if it doesn't exist) and insert the travel data into the table.
    - The `Database` class will also have a `showGui()` method that will display the data in a JTable. The GUI will allow the user to select the language and regional settings to display the offers.

2. **TravelData Class**
    - The `TravelData` class will be responsible for reading the data from the files in the `data` directory and storing them in a list of `Offer` objects.
    - The `TravelData` class will have a `getOffersDescriptionsList(String loc, String dateFormat)` method that will return a list of strings, each string being a description of an offer. The description will be formatted according to the locale and date format provided.

3. **Offer Class**
    - The `Offer` class will be a simple data class that will hold the details of each offer. It will have fields for locale, country, departure date, return date, place, price, and currency.

4. **Main Class**
    - The `Main` class will create an instance of `TravelData` and `Database`. It will call the `getOffersDescriptionsList()` method on the `TravelData` instance and print the descriptions. It will then call the `create()` and `showGui()` methods on the `Database` instance.

Tasks:

1. Implement the `Database` class with `create()` and `showGui()` methods.
2. Implement the `TravelData` class with `getOffersDescriptionsList()` method.
3. Implement the `Offer` class with appropriate fields and methods.
4. Update the `Main` class to use the `TravelData` and `Database` classes.
5. Test the application with different locales and date formats.
6. Handle any exceptions and edge cases.
7. Document the code.
